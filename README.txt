This project focuses on structural anaylsis for any given 
beam cross section using beam theorey (Moment Area Theorems)
and some cool plotting functions in matlab

This project respectively has one big file with all the calculations, 
that file imports another one that contains a given cross-section, this made it easy to check for any given cross section and mad
itieration calculations much faster i included design 0, and the final itieration we went with (even though it wasn't too good,
we made some mistakes while building and had to go with it) goodluck on ur civ bridge project if ur a 3T0 seeing this

for MATLAB, please dont open it ur own IDE but open it in the matlab desktop app or browser since its a 
livescript file.
